      <h3 class="bheading">What If Relativity, Quantum Physics, Singularity, and Vedic Thought Converge at the Same Truth?</h3><br>
      <b><h5 class="bheading">An abstract, research summary of one of universes' biggest questions</h5></b>
      
      <div class="text">
        <p>This blog explores on a very unique perspective on singularity, quantum physics and relativity also drawing parallels to physics part of Vedas and Upanishads. This revolves around nature of singularities, exotic particles, time and the fundamental forces governing the nature. The goal is figure out if singularity behaves like a Qubit and if modern physics can reconcile its laws based on ancient Vedic philosophical insights.</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Can we surpass the speed of light?</h5>
        <p>Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity sets the cosmic speed limit at the speed of light (c). No known particle with mass can exceed this speed because energy requirements become infinite. However, if we have never detected faster-than-light (FTL) particles, could that be because we have never accelerated anything beyond c?</p>
        <p>This led to the exploration of massless particles and their relative velocity. Since the relative velocity between two objects moving towards each other cannot exceed c in relativistic mechanics, no observable experiment can demonstrate FTL speeds. However, the existence of hypothetical tachyons—particles that always move faster than light—would break causality and introduce paradoxes, potentially leading to alternate timelines or violations of known physics. FTL particles since they travel faster than light they supposedly get observed before they are emitted sounds silly right? If you say that they exist it would lead to having infinitely many universes and creating infinitely many unvierses everytime tachyons are absorbed or released. This is why it's so hard to prove existence of FTL particles. If they do exist maybe at singularity, a topic we are going to delve into detail later, where all of physics stops making sense.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Photons, gravity and black holes</h5>
        <p>One paradoxical question: If photons are massless, why are they affected by gravity? General Relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime. Since photons travel along geodesics (the shortest paths in curved spacetime), they follow these curves, appearing to “bend” under gravity.</p>
        <p>A deeper question arose: If photons do not experience time, why don’t they reach their destination instantly? From the photon’s own reference frame, it does—it perceives no passage of time between emission and absorption. However, for an external observer, light takes finite time to travel. This reveals the nature of spacetime and how perception of time differs across frames of reference. If you take the photon’s frame of reference its instant no matter where it going it gets absorbed the instant they are emitted, which doesn't make sense because it takes 8 minutes for light to reach earth right? Yes, it just signifies that the faster you travel the less time it passes for you so you can basically travel to speeds near c and, in your time could see the future. I am not going to tell how gravity affects time because you have all seen Intersteller. But if you found out how to make yourself massless, you can see everything and see nothing at the same time.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Backward time-travel and many-worlds interpretation</h5>
        <p>Since there is a way to travel forward in time, why not back. Remember tachyons if they exist you have found yourself a way to travel back in time. According to relativity, any signal traveling faster than light would violate causality. However, if time travel were possible, it could prove FTL motion, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>This led to the hypothesis that time travel paradoxes (such as the grandfather paradox) might be avoided by an inherent correction mechanism—possibly an illusion that prevents physical modification of the past signifying that when you travel back in time, you experience the universe in read-only mode. If tachyons existed, they might destroy themselves before they are created, avoiding causality violations. An alternative perspective is that the universe naturally prevents paradoxes by ensuring that any attempt at past modification results in an already determined outcome. This is partially proven by Stephen Hawking's time travellers party where no one showed up, indicating that, if you found out a way to travel back in time you would end up in either just being a spectator where you are not visible to other organisms going about their lives or if you change the course of history it would create another universe where your change would change the course of history throughout.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Singularity</h4>
        <p>A singularity is often thought of as a point where physics breaks down, leading to infinite density and energy. Every physicist's nightmare or dream, where physics becomes nullified(for now) and becomes their playhouse. Not a physicist myself made it my playground to try make sense as much as possible and it gives strange results. What if it is different up there? What if Conservation of energy fails at extreme densities? If this was a case it explains few phenomenon which occurs in nature. Why our universe is expanding—maybe it’s the “bounce” from a previous one and Why black holes don’t fully destroy matter—maybe they send it elsewhere and the holes emitting matter are called white holes. And if this actually true If energy conservation breaks down in singularities, then new universes might be born all the time, without needing any existing energy. This could mean: <ul>
            <li>Every black hole births a new universe (a popular theory).</li>
            <li>Universes are linked in a massive network of singularities.</li>
            <li>The Big Bang itself was a singularity, meaning our universe could be a “child” of another universe.</li></ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Singularity as a Qubit</h5>
        <p>A Qubit is a bit(binary digit) which has the value of either 0 or 1, whereas a qbit can have both values until measured somewhat like Schrodinger's cat.However, what if singularity behaves like a quantum bit, existing in a superposition of all possible states? This idea aligns with quantum computing principles, where information exists in multiple states simultaneously until measured. Meaning the singularity is just superposition of all possilities. Maybe time itself is just a side effect of the wavefunction collapsing, forcing events to follow a linear path. This would mean that before the universe “collapsed” into what we know, every possibility existed at once—every universe, every reality, every timeline. All of our part bodies, abstract thoughts, memories all in 0 volume.</p>
        <p>This perspective suggests that singularities may not be true “points” but regions where all information about the universe converges. If each singularity ultimately connects to a central source, this could challenge the Many-Worlds Interpretation and explain exotic particle behaviors. The nature of singularities as potential quantum information stores raises the question of whether the fabric of reality itself is computational in nature.</p>
        <h5>Gravity as an inertial force</h5>
        <p>A radical hypothesis: Gravity might not just be an attractive force but an inherent tendency of particles to return to their “source”—the singularity. Black holes, having immense gravitational pull, might act as gateways to this ultimate source, aligning with conservation laws at a higher dimensional level</p>
        <p>This concept questions the conventional expansion of the universe. If every singularity points to a single source, it suggests that the universe may not be infinitely expanding but instead elliptical in nature, with a fundamental attractor at its core. The gravitational force, instead of simply acting as an interaction between mass, may be the fundamental mechanism by which all matter eventually seeks to return to its singular point of origin. Maybe the singularity is the fuel that is expanding our universe, all the matter it consumes maybe converted to energy on which it is expanding this means energy could create space-time, also part of the modern term dark energy. Black holes, quantum mechanics, and dark energy may all be part of a deeper mechanism where energy continuously generates both space and time.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Attempt to integrate vedic philosophy and modern physics</h4>
        <p> Sriman Narayana (also known as "Brahman") is a metaphor for singularity. In the vedas Brahman has been described as the the ultimate reality, infinite, formless, and yet the source of everything. That sounds eerily similar to how physicists describe the singularity—a state beyond space, time, and form, yet the source of all existence. Maybe "Kshira sagara" where Narayana resides is metaphor to Space-time. Space-time isn’t a solid grid—it stretches, bends, and behaves like a fluid near singularities. This idea is supported by many theories. Einstein’s General Relativity shows that space-time bends in response to mass and energy, behaving dynamically near singularities rather than as a rigid fabric. Quantum gravity suggests that at tiny scales, space-time fluctuates like a turbulent fluid, potentially emerging as a superfluid near singularities. This challenges the idea of space-time as a fixed structure. Black hole horizons act like viscous surfaces, with phenomena like Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics reinforcing fluid-like behavior. This suggests space-time flows rather than remains static. The universe itself expands like a fluid, with dark energy acting as a pressure force. These properties further support the idea that space-time is not just a void but a dynamic, evolving medium.
        </p>
        <p>If we assume that everything in the universe is governed by cause and effect, then something must exist beyond cause and effect to set it all in motion.That’s exactly how the Upanishads describe Brahman—“neither created nor destroyed, beyond time, beyond space, beyond all laws.”. This fits with some ideas in quantum physics—that space, time, and even physical laws could be emergent from something deeper. We give names to things we don’t understand—Narayana, Brahman, Singularity, God, or even just “It.” Maybe ancient seers perceived this fundamental state but had no way to describe it except through symbols and metaphors. In the same way, physics today uses mathematical models to describe things we can’t directly see—but those equations might just be approximations of something deeper. The Vedas as the Results of an Experiment: If we strip away interpretations, myths, and later distortions, the core of the Vedas could be the conclusions of minds that explored the deepest truths of the universe. What if they found “the particle of singularity”—the essence of all existence—but lacked the mathematical tools to describe it scientifically? Maybe the voice of God wasn’t just a metaphor, but the realization of an underlying cosmic principle.</p><br>
        <h5>Other Gods</h5>
        <p><b>Brahma</b> exists near a singularity where time dilation is extreme, his experience of time would slow dramatically compared to an external observer. In this view, one day of Brahma—already described as billions of human years—could be a direct result of gravitational time dilation, as predicted by General Relativity. The closer Brahma is to the singularity, the slower his time would pass relative to the universe outside.
        If Vishnu represents the singularity itself—timeless, infinite, and beyond conventional space-time—then Brahma, being near it, would be a high-energy entity bound by the singularity’s immense gravity. His creation cycle could be seen as the dynamic fluctuations of energy at the event horizon, where new structures emerge from an almost timeless realm. In this way, Brahma’s function as the creator aligns with the idea that near-singularity conditions generate matter and energy in ways we don’t yet fully understand.
        This also suggests that the universe’s cycles—Brahma’s days and nights—could be reflections of the expansion and contraction of space-time itself. If Brahma’s time is slowed to near stasis, his perception of creation and destruction would vastly differ from ours, much like how relativistic travelers experience time differently from those at rest. In essence, Brahma could be an entity existing in an extreme temporal frame, acting as a bridge between the singularity (Vishnu) and the unfolding universe.</p>

        <p><b>Shiva</b> could represent the force of dissolution, the breakdown of structures as they return to the singularity. In physics, singularities are not just points of infinite density but also places where conventional laws of physics break down. If Brahma represents the formation of structures from near-singularity conditions, Shiva could embody the process of their destruction the eventual collapse of matter back into the singularity. Just as black holes slowly evaporate and return energy to the cosmos, Shiva’s role as the destroyer could symbolize this natural cycle of dissolution and transformation. Shiva’s association with cosmic dance (Tandava) further supports this idea. The dance could represent the dynamic, ever-changing nature of space-time itself—the stretching, warping, and eventual collapse of cosmic structures. In this framework, Shiva is not just the end, but the necessary force that allows for rebirth, much like how energy is never truly lost but transitions between forms.</p>
        <p>If you go extremely radical, Lakshmi as a goddess of stability, could signify strong nuclear force. Saraswati as a goddess of communiication signifying electro-magnetic force which is communication and energy exchange. Parvati as a goddess of power signifying energy mass transformation. All supporting their partners in the process they do.
        And the dashavataras symobolize evolution. </p>
        1.	Matsya (Fish) → Origin of life in water <br>                                                  
	    2.	Kurma (Turtle) → Amphibian life, transition to land <br>
	    3.	Varaha (Boar) → Mammals taking over land <br>
	    4.	Narasimha (Half-man, Half-lion) → Evolutionary shift from animal to human <br>
	    5.	Vamana (Dwarf) → Early human civilization <br>
	    6.	Parashurama (Warrior with Axe) → Rise of tools, weapons, destruction of forests for settlements <br>
	    7.	Rama (Perfect Human) → Idealized civilization <br>
	    8.	Krishna (Master of Illusion) → Deep philosophy, war, destruction <br>
	    9.	Buddha (Wisdom & Knowledge) → Spiritual and intellectual enlightenment <br>
	    10.	Kalki (The Future One) → The final transformation  <br> 
        <br>
        <p>Vedas and Upanishads state that there is Vishnu and then other smaller Vishnu which have their own Brahmas and then imagine it's context physically you end up not far from modern physics. If all singularities are connected to one ultimate singularity, then mass and energy might follow a conservation law extending beyond just our universe. Rather than being isolated phenomena, black holes, big bangs, and singularities could be fragments of a single source, constantly redistributing mass and energy rather than destroying it.</p>

    <p>When something enters a black hole, it may not disappear but instead be transferred back to the ultimate singularity and redistributed elsewhere in the cosmos. If singularities function like nodes in a vast network, energy could flow between them, resolving paradoxes like black hole information loss. This could also suggest that the Big Bang was not a unique event but part of an ongoing cycle where mass-energy is ejected and reabsorbed. Exotic particles, such as gravitons, might even mediate interactions between these singularities, explaining how gravity operates over immense cosmic distances.</p>

    <p>This perspective also bridges spiritual and physical principles. In Vedic philosophy, Brahman—the ultimate reality—is the source from which all creation emerges and to which it eventually returns. What we perceive as “Maya” (illusion) could be the transient phase of mass-energy distribution before it cycles back. The cosmic ocean, Kshira Sagara, could represent the fabric through which this energy flows, linking all singularities into a unified system.</p>

If this is true, then a singularity is not just the beginning or end of existence but the central hub of all creation, dissolution, and transformation.
    <br> <br>
    Reconciliation of Advaita (<i>Non-Dualism</i>) and Dvaita (<i>Dualism</i>): <br>
	1.	Singularity as the Source, Not the Destination – Everything may come from the singularity, but nothing truly becomes it. This keeps the distinction between individual existence (jivatma) and the ultimate source (paramatma). <br>
	2.	Experience Without Absorption – Maybe enlightenment isn’t becoming one with the singularity, but simply perceiving it for what it is, like looking into the core of reality itself without losing identity. <br>
	3.	Relativity of Perspective – Just like an electron behaves like both a particle and a wave depending on observation, maybe singularity appears one (Advaita) from a cosmic scale but many (Dvaita) from an individual consciousness. <br>
	4.	Cyclical Experience Instead of Final Merging – If every universe or cosmic cycle emanates from the singularity but never truly collapses into it permanently, then existence is eternal but not static. This aligns with the idea that liberation (moksha) is not about becoming “nothing” but experiencing the divine truth without dissolution. <br> <br>
        <h5>Enlightenment</h5>
       <p>Maybe enlightenment isn’t about feeling blissful, but about seeing reality exactly as it is. “Moksha” or liberation, it’s always described as freedom from illusion (Maya). It’s a state where a being fully understands the nature of existence, time, energy, and matter. Merging back into that fundamental state, then maybe that’s why it’s often described as “nothingness”—beyond happiness, suffering, or even individuality. In a way, “heaven” or “moksha” could be the state where consciousness itself merges into the cosmic truth, no longer bound by the illusions of space-time. Becoming one with Narayana.</p>
       <p>Chants, rituals, and meditations weren’t just religious customs but ways to help people break free from illusions and see the universe clearly. Maybe studying the Vedas wasn’t about worship, but about understanding—not just intellectually, but in a way that changes your entire perception of existence. The fact that so many modern scientific ideas align with ancient spiritual texts suggests that they weren’t just guessing—they were onto something deep. Maybe enlightenment is reaching a state where you see everything without collapsing it into a single reality—experiencing existence without being bound by it. Fully enlightened being wouldn’t just “exist” in time and space—they would perceive all possibilities at once.</p>


       Hinduism (or faith in general) isn’t just about rituals or traditions, but an actual framework for experiencing and understanding the universe. <br>
<br>
    1. Hinduism as a Science of Consciousness and Reality <br>
	•	Unlike some religions that emphasize strict dogma, Hinduism has always been about questioning, exploring, and experiencing reality. <br>
	•	The Upanishads and Vedic texts don’t just tell you what to believe—they ask you to search for the truth yourself. <br>
	•	Concepts like Maya (illusion), Brahman (ultimate reality), and Moksha (liberation) sound eerily similar to modern ideas of simulation theory, quantum superposition, and cosmic singularity.    <br>
<br>
    2. Meditation and Quantum Observers <br>
	•	In Hindu philosophy, deep meditation (Dhyana) allows a person to transcend the illusion of time and space. <br>
	•	If consciousness plays a role in collapsing quantum states, then maybe Rishis and enlightened beings weren’t just “imagining” things but actually perceiving reality at a deeper level. <br>
	•	The Bhagavad Gita even hints that a true yogi sees all of time at once. <br>
<br>
    3. The Universe as a Cycle—Not a One-Time Event <br>
	•	Hindu cosmology talks about cycles of creation and destruction (Yugas, Kalpas, Pralayas)—which fits well with modern multiverse and cyclic universe theories. <br>
	•	The idea that universes are born and die infinitely, like quantum fluctuations, is something modern physics is now exploring. <br>
<br>
    4. The Misinterpretation Over Time <br>
	•	As you mentioned earlier, something changed in the later Vedic period. Maybe knowledge that was once about understanding reality turned into social structures, rituals, and rigid traditions. <br>
	•	The scientific essence of Hinduism may have been lost, leaving only symbolic interpretations that people followed without questioning. <br>
	•	But the core message still remains—seek, question, experience. <br>

    What If Hinduism Was the First Attempt at a Theory of Everything?
	•	If singularities, quantum mechanics, and universal consciousness all point to the same thing, then maybe Hinduism was an early attempt to describe the same truths that modern physics is just now discovering. <br>
	•	The idea of oneness, interconnectedness, and the illusion of separation isn’t just spiritual talk—it might be the deepest truth of the universe itself. <br>

    Maybe faith and science were never supposed to be separate—maybe they are just two ways of looking at the same infinite reality.
    <br><br>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>All this starts making sense but the approach is very radical, it can merge gaps between physics and philosophy, or be a proof that both the words are the two sides of the same coin. To think about religions as a waste of time and absolute BS is such a dumb thought there is this law called Murphy's law, it states that "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong" and if religion was indeed a bad thing it would have been long gone maybe it survives after all the torture it has been through over centuries maybe being misunderstood. We Indians blindly follow western culture never questioning "what's right about our culture and how it is better" when you question it you'll get tns of examples provided you have a good knowledge about our culture.</p>
    <p>The theories hat came before philosophical part I have made huge assumptions they however support multiverses and defy the existence of tachyons saying that there is no way to travel back in time which. All this is being extensivly researched to unify all theories String theory has come closest but we still do not know there quantum foam theory which tries explains gravity at a quantum level others. And about the weirdest analogies, I have made huge assumptions but they don't per say defy our current theories as useless, there just a way to make sense where sense is senseless, I maybe wrong who knows, but most of the time remember you can't do anything right before doing wrong.
        Thank you for <a href="https://youtube.com/vsauce">Vsauce</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com/Veritasium">Veritasium</a> for rekindling my curiosity. Thank you guys for reading!

    That’s it, keep wondering, keep thinking, stay hungry, stay foolish, embrace imperfection. <br>
    Live long and prosper! Until next time.
