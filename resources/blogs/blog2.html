  <h3 class="bheading">My First Set of Open-Source Contributions</h3>
  <div class="text">
    <p>On October 10th, 2024, the NIE IEEE Student Branch (NISB) held a workshop on open-source contributions because Hacktoberfest had started. For those who don’t know, Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source contributions that rewards you for participating, more on it in the end. During the workshop, they covered version control, GitHub, how to clone repositories, make changes, and submit a pull request (PR).</p>
    <p>Open-source contributions have always amazed me—the idea of making changes to something that is visible worldwide is incredible. This workshop ignited a spark in me; I was filled with curiosity. I was very excited, and though it was a 2-day workshop, I had to go home on the morning of the second day. I tried to gather as much information as possible about what I missed, and the next morning, I left for Bengaluru.</p>
    <p>The first thing I did after greeting my parents was to open my laptop and install Git Bash. When I read the documentation on how to clone a repo, Bash was frequently mentioned. Bash has a steep learning curve, but I managed to grasp the basics and cloned the repository created by NISB called Code-Alchemy to my PC. I started adding solutions—simple ones like linear search and insertion sort in Java. The files were initially in C++, but my seniors assured me it was okay to submit the solutions in any language, so I used Java. Using Bash, I submitted a pull request.</p>
    <p>However, one bad habit I picked up from LeetCode was forgetting to convert arrays to strings. When you return an array from a function, it returns the memory address, and excited as I was, I didn’t check the output before creating and sending the PR. Not long after, the head of the repo pointed out the mistake in my code. I had to close the PR, add Arrays.toString(), and create the PR again. I can’t put into words how happy I was when I received the email saying my code had been accepted! At that point, my only goal was to successfully merge 4 PRs.</p>
    <p>With this excitement, I opened the email and received a sticker from Holopin, a platform that issues stickers for Hacktoberfest. I didn’t know what to do with it, but it was cool. I then started checking out other repositories with the Hacktoberfest tag, but I didn’t find anything that matched my skill level. That’s when I returned to Code-Alchemy and found two more problems similar to ones I had solved on LeetCode. One required returning the first unique character, which I solved using LinkedHashMap, and the other involved shifting a given number of elements from the end of an array to the beginning.</p>
    <p>By this time, I had discovered GitHub Desktop—a real lifesaver! It made my workflow much easier. I could clone repositories, open them in VS Code, edit the files, and make commits all in one place. I started using GitHub Desktop for the remaining 3 PRs.</p>
    <p>The next PR involved a problem that almost made me pull my hair out. I had to reverse the order of words in a sentence, but the words themselves needed to remain intact. Determined to solve it, I delved into Java’s documentation and found two string functions: trim() and split(). After some trial and error, I decided to use split(), which takes a character as an argument and splits the string into an array of words. After obtaining the array of words separated by whitespace, reversing the array was straightforward.</p>
    <p>The following problems involved binary search algorithms. The first problem I tackled was unrelated to binary search—it required eliminating duplicate data blocks and sorting them. I used an ArrayList because with a regular array, it’s difficult to know the final size. I applied insertion sort to the array before populating the ArrayList, and then returned the sorted array of unique elements.</p>
    <p>The next problem was to find a target memory address among a list of addresses using binary search, which was simple enough. However, the final problem was quite challenging. I had to return the indices of broken nodes from a list of network nodes. I iterated through the list of broken nodes, used binary search to find their indices, added the indices to an ArrayList, and finally returned the indices as an array.</p>
    <p>With that, I completed Hacktoberfest! To officially finish, your pull requests must remain merged for a week, so I had to wait until October 21st, 2024, to write this blog. Below, I’ll attach links to my Hacktoberfest profile, my Holopin profile, and my pull requests to Code-Alchemy.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed reading this blog! Have a great life ahead. Until next time, goodbye!</p>
