  <h3 class="bheading">Student Induction Programme 2024</h3>
  <div class="text">
    <h3 class="sheading">28th September</h3>
    <p>I reached the college quite early and found a long queue. I asked people around for the Information Science and Technology queue; someone pointed it out, and I stood in line for about three minutes. After signing the attendance sheet, I received my ID card, a bottle, and a box of juice. We were then asked to go inside the auditorium where the program was supposed to begin. After the ceremonial lamp lighting and the introduction of the chief guest, Dr. Janaki CH, a scientist at CDAC Bengaluru, her presentation was truly captivating. She also discussed the internship opportunities available at CDAC.</p>
    <p>Following Dr. Janaki's words, we had a lunch break. After lunch, the vice principal and the Academic Affairs team addressed us, making us aware of the discipline and exam culture at NIE. This was followed by the chief examination officer and the head of the research department, who informed us about the research opportunities at NIE.</p>
    <p>On this day, I had to move into the hostel. We filled out the forms and signed the papers required to join the hostel. I brought most of my belongings but needed to buy a few more items. After purchasing those, we had dinner at The Indian Curry House, which was followed by my parents leaving. My first night at the NIE hostel was quite pleasant; I slept well, which led to a bright Sunday morning.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="sheading">29th September</h3>
    <p>Sunday was relaxed as usual; I woke up late but did manage to catch breakfast. After wandering around and binge-watching a movie on Netflix, I decided to go to ISKCON to refresh my mind. The ISKCON campus is beautiful, and the temple was magnificent. There, I received the prasad of Pudiogare. Afterward, I indulged in more Netflix.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="sheading">30th September</h3>
    <p>I woke up late again because I had slept very late the previous night. I had my breakfast at the cafeteria and proceeded with the day's activities. The speaker of the day was Dr. Dharma Prasad, a professional speaker who talked about the significance of confidence and how to overcome failure. His talk was very inspiring, followed by a tea break. After that, there was a panel discussion featuring Dr. Dharma Prasad, Mr. Vishwa Rao, vice president of JK Tyres Ltd, and Mr. Rajesh Khudnikar, the CEO of IT Champs. The panel discussion was primarily a Q&A session where Dr. Dharma Prasad posed questions, and both dignitaries provided insightful answers. It was inspiring to hear how these individuals managed to succeed and attain such high ranks in their professions.</p>
    <p>After the panel discussion, we had a lunch break, followed by ETCAC discussions led by the heads of their respective subjects. We were asked to choose an ETC and an ESC, except for the branch we had opted for in Engineering.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="sheading">1st October</h3>
    <p>It started off with a talk by Dr. G. Venkatesh Kumar, Dean of Science and Technology and Psychology at the University of Mysore. It was a highly interactive session, where he engaged the audience with games to illustrate the importance of self-confidence. This was followed by a tea break, after which Dr. C.V. Gopinath, retired Additional Secretary of the Government of India, gave a fascinating speech about the connection between science, technology, and Vedic sciences, highlighting the significance of ancient scholars like Aryabhata, Bhaskara, and Sushruta.</p>
    <p>
    Following him, Pavana Prana Prabhu from ISKCON delivered an inspiring talk on how to control the mind and avoid distractions to focus on our goals. This was then followed by a lunch break and an address by the Dean of Infrastructure and Planning, who discussed the proposed future infrastructure projects at NIE. He emphasized that most of the buildings at NIE are not outsourced; instead, they are being constructed by civil engineers who studied at NIE. This was followed by club introductions, beginning with the Idea Lab team. The video they presented was amazing and encouraged many of us to join the Idea Club. Several other clubs introduced themselves afterward, including IEEE, Onyx, OWASP, EdSoc, Vignan Tarangi,  ಕನ್ನಡ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳ ಒಕ್ಕೂಟ and many more.
    </p>
    <p>The day culminated in the highlight of the week: the Talent Search and performances by seniors. Every performance was electrifying. The standout was a rapper who used explicit language; everyone was awestruck by his confidence. Many were surprised by the talents of my friend Richa, who performed with her friends Aadya and Devanshi, showcasing life at Kota in a humorous skit. There were also exciting dance performances by our seniors, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The day concluded at 8:00 PM, followed by dinner.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="sheading">2nd October</h3>
    <p>My roommate Guna and I decided to cycle to one of the most serene places in Mysore, Kukrahalli Kere. We cycled using my bike app, which was quite fun. After breakfast, Richa, Srirangan, Anmol, Aadya, and I visited the zoo. We had a blast, took lots of pictures, and enjoyed each other's company. We all connected on LinkedIn afterward. After that, I returned to the hostel, where I needed to buy some items to prepare for college, which has begun October 3, 2024. I'll be back again to tell some more of my stories. Until then, goodbye!</p>
