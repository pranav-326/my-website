        <p>One random night in march I was staring at the ceiling Few sentences ran through my mind Well, they kind of accidentally rhymed.
        
            I've been pouring my heart and soul into poetry since then. It's been a journey of emotions, reflections,  and creativity. <br><br>

    <h2><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/17891829-Too-Gentle--by-Pranav527">Too Gentle</a></h2>
    <pre class="great-vibes-regular1 size-bada"> 
        Amidst of stars you seem so bright
        How fortunate I am to see two moons at night 
        
        Aren't you too gentle for the earth?
        An angel whispered heaven is still estimating your worth 
        
        You make diamonds seem impure
        If getting lost in your eyes were an illness I hope they never find a cure 
        
        Blessing the grass you go on to brush
        On your sight tulips and lillies blush 
        
        If loving you would ever cost my life 
        Pierce through my heart with thy knife</pre>

        <h2><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/17932350-Whispers-of-the-rain--by-Pranav527">Whispers of the rain</a></h2>
        <pre class="great-vibes-regular1 size-bada"> 
            Dropeth like heaven from the sky,
            Only time when a man is supposed to cry.
            Footsteps of dance they once did with grace,
            Puddles of water which mirrored her moonlit face.
            She left the rain for autumn's cool breeze;
            With gusts of grief, the rain longed to freeze.
            In every snowflake, a story lies,
            Of laughter, tears, and silent goodbyes.

        <h2><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/17891861-Dream-day-by-Pranav527">Dream day</a></h2>
        <pre class="great-vibes-regular1 size-bada"> 
            You're so magical; with you around, wands may not work.
            When you suddenly look me in the eye, my heart seems to jerk.
            With you around, time flies so soon.
            We met early in the morning; now it's late afternoon.
            Tripping and falling as we run,
            tired, we lay down to watch the setting sun.
            Enshrouding your form with sun-kissed sand,
            tumbles like a gold waterfall as you stand.
            Writing our names as it gets washed by the wave,
            warming ourselves beside a fire in an echoing cave.
            In the light of flames, you are a vision to behold;
            like a phoenix rising, your body seems to gleam and unfold.
            Strumming your ukulele as you begin to sing
            makes this rock seem like a pillow made of a swan's wing.

        <h2><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/18008547-feather-to-the-earth--by-Pranav527">feather to the earth</a></h2>
        <pre class="great-vibes-regular1 size-bada"> 
            Took a walk, saw a stream which reminded of you.
            Suddenly the wind told about your heart so true.
            In the sight of you, ever so silent, giraffes talk.
            For you, the laziest of the lazy sloths, are ready to walk.
            By your side, the trees happily sway.
            To your voice, birds fly to you from far, far away.
            How did you end up on the Earth with a soul so pure?
            Maybe you’re exactly what she needs, the ultimate cure.

        <pre class="great-vibes-regular1 size-bada"> 
            You are the kind of girl poets write poems about,
            If you go to a garden, flowers can't help but pout.
            I don't know how many pages I'll take to describe you, but it's going to be alot.
            You are the kind of girl I can't stop thinking about.

        <h2><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/17899428-My-heart-my-mind.-Ugh--Such-a-mess-by-Pranav527">My heart my mind. Ugh! Such a mess</a></h2>
        <pre class="great-vibes-regular1 size-bada"> 
            My broken heart was crying still, My mind sat and asked what was the grief. <br> Heart replied meeting a person I never will, Reason for its tears was not in brief.
            The mind then pondered, seeking peace, In memories of the days once shared. <br> The heart, however, found no ease, For love's own fire had not yet pared.
            In dreams, they met on paths untold, A silent whisper, a fleeting glance. <br> The heart held on, though growing cold, To hope of one more fated chance.
            To meet or not was part of destiny My mind, my heart, ugh such a mess, <br> Future holds for what's meant to be. It's like I and me are playing a game of chess.

        <h2><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/17891875-One-of-many..-by-Pranav527">One of many..</a></h2>
        <pre class="great-vibes-regular1 size-bada"> 
            I would count all the stars,
            Tolerate the pains of gunshot scars,

            To prove I love you to Neptune and back,
            I would ask the night not to turn the sky black.

            They say beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder;
            I would blindly fall for you, even if my heart was a boulder.

            But to you, I am just one of many;
            To me, you're just more precious than any.
